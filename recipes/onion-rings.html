            <li>1 quart oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup milk, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>3/4 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1/8 teapsoon seasoned salt, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol class="text">
            <li>Slice onion into 1/4-inch-thick rings. Heat oil in a deep fryer to 185 degrees C.
                Place a wire rack over a sheet of aluminium foil.
            </li>
            <li>Prepare breading station by setting out 3 wide, shallow dishes. Whisk flour, baking
                powder, and salt together in the first dish. Whisk milk and egg together in the second
                dish. Place bread crumbs in the third dish.
            </li>
            <li>Dip each onion ring into the flour mixture, turning several times until fully coated
                with flour.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer to the egg mixture and use a fork to turn until coated. Lift onion with the 
                fork and shake gently so excess liquid drips back into the dish.
            </li>
            <li>Place onion in the bread crumbs and turn several times to coat, scooping crumbs
                over the ring if necessary.
            </li>
            <li>Lift again with the fork, tap any excess bread crumbs back into the dish, and 
                place on the wire rack while you prepare the remaining onion rings.
            </li>
            <li>Deep-fry 3 to 4 onion rings at a time in the preheated oil for 2 to 3 minutes,
                until golden-brown. Drain on paper towels while you deep-fry the remaining rings.
            </li>
            <li>Sprinkle with seasoning salt before serving.</li>
        </ol>
