        <p>This recipe will give you 4 servings of buttery, fluffy, and lump-free mashed potatoes every time!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large russet potatoes, peeled and cut in half lengthwise</li>
            <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil.
                Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Drain potatoes, then return to the pot. Turn heat to high and allow potatoes
                to dry for about 30 seconds. Turn off heat.
            </li>
            <li>Mash potatoes with a potato masher twice around the pot, then add milk and butter.
                Continue to mash until smooth and fluffy. Whisk in salt and black pepper until evenly
                distributed, about 15 seconds.
            </li>
        </ol>
