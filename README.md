# Introduction
In this project, I will be building a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

Upon completion of this project, I would have practiced HTML and git, specifically:
- using appropriate elements and tags, including headers, lists, and links
- working with text properly, including the use of bold and italicized text
- using and including images appropriately
- creating commit messages effectively
